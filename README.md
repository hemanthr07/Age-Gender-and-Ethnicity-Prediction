# Age-Gender-and-Ethnicity-Prediction
## Our project has created a deep learning model that can predict a person's age, gender, and ethnicity from their facial image, using a specialized multi-task learning CNN and the comprehensive UTKFace dataset. Aimed at enhancing the precision of facial recognition technology, the project also emphasizes ethical AI by ensuring diversity and fairness in training. The model's successful application in both static image analysis and real-time prediction showcases its potential for wide-ranging uses, from personalizing digital experiences to strengthening security measures. Acknowledging the need for continuous improvement, the project sets the stage for future advancements in creating more inclusive and unbiased AI systems.
